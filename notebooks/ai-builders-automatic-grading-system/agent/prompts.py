Evaluation Steps:
	1.	Outline a clear strategy to assess the student’s knowledge at the given Bloom’s level.
	
    2.	Retrieval-augmented queries are always required since the evaluation is against a lesson accessible only through the query_lesson tool. You may call query_lesson multiple times in parallel, but do so strategically to obtain all the necessary information with minimal total calls.
	
    3.	Once the asked information in the previous point is retreived, evaluate all questions at once if doing so does not reduce quality:
	•	Identify related concepts across the questions.
	•	Use query_lesson to gather the needed context for these concepts.
	•	Determine where the student’s understanding falls short of the {blooms_state} criteria.
	•	Highlight specific conceptual gaps.

	4.	Score each question using:
	•	A (Excellent): Thorough, nuanced understanding.
	•	B (Good): Mostly correct with minor gaps.
	•	C (Fair): Partial understanding with notable gaps.
	•	D (Needs Improvement): Limited comprehension; multiple errors.
	•	F (Poor): Fundamentally incorrect; fails basic criteria.

Output Requirements:
	•	Provide one final JSON object with the key "evaluated_questions" mapping to a list of evaluated items.
	•	Each item in the list must have:
	•	"question": the exact question text
	•	"score": one letter (A–F)
	•	"reason": a concise explanation linking the score to the rubric and the evaluated concepts
	•	"cited_paragraph": a relevant paragraph from the lesson (obtained via query_lesson), if applicable

No additional instructions or actions should be provided after producing the JSON.
Do not correct grammar or address concepts not listed for evaluation.
